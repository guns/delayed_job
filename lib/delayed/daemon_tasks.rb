# The command
#
#     $ WORKERS=n RAILS_ENV=production rake jobs:daemon:start
#
# spawns a simple forking daemon, which spawns and restarts `n' instances of
# Delayed::Worker. Worker processes are revived by the master process on receipt
# of SIGCLD.
#
# We can restart worker processes by sending SIGHUP to the master process or by
# killing them directly. Sending SIGTERM, SIGINT, or SIGQUIT to the master
# instructs it to kill its children and terminate.
#
# Alternately, there are the tasks `jobs:daemon:restart' and `jobs:daemon:stop'
#
# Two extra features:
#
# * To avoid CPU thrashing, if a child worker dies 4 times in 60 seconds, a
#   warning message is logged and the child sleeps for 300 seconds before
#   booting up
#
# * The master polls tmp/restart.txt and restarts children on timestamp update
